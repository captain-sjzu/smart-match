# Introduction

The smart-match module contains functions for calculating strings/sets similarity.

## Concept

1. similarity
A value in a range of [0, 1], which represents how similar the two strings are. 
The larger the value, the more similar the two strings are.

2. dissimilarity
A value in a range of [0, 1], which represents how dissimilar the two strings are. 
The larger the value, the more dissimilar the two strings are.
For a pair of strings, similarity = 1 - dissimilarity

3. distance
How far the two strings are. Notice that not all the methods support distance method.

4. score
The larger the score, the more similar the two strings are. Notice not all the methods have score method.

# Installation

```shell
pip install smart-match
```

# Usage

- Default method LE(Levenshtein): It is also called edit distance, which is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

```python
import smart_match
print(smart_match.similarity('hello', 'hero'))
print(smart_match.dissimilarity('hello', 'hero'))
print(smart_match.distance('hello', 'hero'))
```
Output:
```shell
0.6
0.4
2
```

- change to the other methods:

__ED(EuclideanDistance)__: It calculate the euclidean distance of the two stings.

```python
smart_match.use('ED')
print(smart_match.distance('hello', 'hero'))
```
Output:
```shell
0.34921514788478913
```

__DL(Damerau Levenshtein)__: It consider the cost of transposition of two adjacent characters to be 1. 

```python
smart_match.use('DL')
print(smart_match.distance('hello', 'ehllo'))
```
Output:
```shell
1
```

__BD(Block Distance)__: It focuses on the differences in the alphabet without considering the order.

```python
smart_match.use('BD')
print(smart_match.distance('hello', 'ehllo'))
```
Output:
```shell
0
```

__cos(Cosine Similarity)__:  It measures the cosine of the angle between two strings projected in a multi-dimensional space.
Mathematically

print(smart_match.similarity('hello', 'hero'))
```
Output:
```shell
0.5669467095138409
```

__TC(TanimotoCoefficient)__: Tanimoto coefficient is similar to Cosine similarity, but the occurrence of an entry will be taken into consideration.

__dice(Dice Similarity)__:  The similarity between two strings s1 and s2 is twice the number of character pairs that are common to both strings divided by the sum of the number of character pairs in the two strings. It is intended to be applied to discrete data, so the occurrence of an entry will be ignored. 
Mathematically
